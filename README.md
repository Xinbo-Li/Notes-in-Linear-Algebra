# Notes-in-Linear-Algebra
### Description
<p>This repository is a collection of notes on linear algebra written and maintained by myself. This project is meant to target people who are comfortable with elementary proof writing and want to gain elementary insights beyond computations. </p>
<p>I've written the notes in a less formal language to ease the understanding of seemingly complex concepts, emphasizing the importance of grasping rigorous mathematical principles through active engagement, including practicing proof writing. While these notes can serve as a refresher or class reference, I encourage users to delve deeper, considering concrete proofs even when not provided. </p>

### Topics to expect
<ul>
  <li>Terminologies, Proof-writing Techniques</li>
  <li>Matrices in computations

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vector spaces and Linear Transformations
    <ul>
      <li>Vector space, basis, and dimensions</li>
      <li>Change of basis, Diagonalization</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Through tutoring experiences, I've observed common struggles among students in grasping fundamental linear algebra concepts, often due to courses focusing heavily on calculations. While acknowledging the challenge of abstracting mathematical structures for freshman or non-math major students, I advocate for introducing necessary abstractions to provide a comprehensive understanding. Rather than delving into more complex theorems like Jordan canonical forms, which are better explained in the theory of modules, I conclude the notes after covering essential dimension inequalities crucial for frequent use in linear algebra proofs.</p>
