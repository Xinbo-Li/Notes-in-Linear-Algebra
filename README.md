# Notes-in-Linear-Algebra
### Description
<p>This repository is a collection of notes on linear algebra written and maintained by myself. This project is meant to target people who are comfortable with elementary proof writing and want to gain elementary insights beyond computations. </p>
<p>The notes will be written in a less formal language to not burden one from learning the intuition and key ideas behind seemingly complicated concepts in elementary linear algebra. However one shall keep in mind that mathematics is a rigorous art -- in order to truely convince yourself the propositions and theorems are right, one should keep practicing writing out proofs after getting the intuition for "why is this true". </p>
<p>This set of notes could be however you like, but I suggest people work out concrete proofs if they are not presented in the notes. This set of notes could be either used as a refresh of memories, or as a serious text that could be referenced for classes.</p>

<p>Explanation for the choice of topics: I have found out, through my tutoring experiences, that most people, after taking an elementary linear algebra course, still cannot understand basic ideas in linear algebra. The intro-level courses in linear algebra, in many colleges and high schools, lean towards calculations other than abstractions. Although I recognize the difficulty for abstracting mathematical structures with freshman or non-math major students, some abstractions are necessary for people to see the whole picture. I would rather not go through more complicated theorems like Jordan canonical forms, as I personally think it is better explained in the theory of modules (structure theorem). As a result, I choose to stop after proving some essential dimension inequalities (in the sense that personally I would use them in very high frequency when I do proofs in linear algebra, even in abstract algebra).</p>
